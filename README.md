# this program is simulating a simple thermostat

```
As a technician
I can build a thermostat
I want the thermostat has a starting default_temperature

As a technician
I can make any changes to the thermostat
I want to increase the temperature up

As a technician
I can make any changes to the thermostat
I want to decrease the temperature down

As a technician
I can setup a minimum temperature to the thermostat
I want that the temperature does not go below the limit of 10 degrees

As a technician,
so I do not use too much energey,
I want the maximum settable temperature to be 25 degrees,
when power saving mode is on.
